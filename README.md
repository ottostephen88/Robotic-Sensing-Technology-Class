# Robotic-Sensing-Technology-Class
## Project 1 
Practiced using arrays and pulling data from a document using Python.
## Project 2
Project 2 used Arduino to read data from a DHT sensor and transfer it over to LabView to organize it.
## Project 3
In a python file converted a string to Morse Code "dots" and "dashes". Read the light with Arduino and transfered it to Labview using the Serial Port and decrypted it.
## Project 4 
For the first part of the project created a radar using a servo motor, ultra sonic sensor, and raspberry pi. Then for the second part attached a second servo motor and looked forward from the object portrayed on the radar using PID control.
